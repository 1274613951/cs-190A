This is our github folder for CMPSC190A final project: Reinforcement Learning Race Car. The folder includes all of the models (trained and half-trained). The final model is saved as grpc_python\saved_models\lap1_model.zip. 
Before testing the result and running greeter_server.py, make sure to uncomment 'runMyModel' and comment out 'trainMyModel'. Start the server first then start the Unity simulation.
